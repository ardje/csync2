Description: cluster synchronization tool with db daemon
 CSYNC2 synchronizes files in a cluster using the rsync-algorithm.
 It maintains a database of modified files so it is able to handle
 deletion of files and file modification conflicts.
 This version includes an sqlite database "daemon" to serialize access to the
 database file (instead of trying an flock each second).
